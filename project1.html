		<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>I served a hybrid role on Team Sillies, much like everyone else. My primary responsibilties included:</p>
		<p> • Sound Design: Creating, mixing, and implementing SFX and ambience</p>
		<p> • Item Art: Designing for items and style and finalizing sprites for interaction</p>
		<p> • Puzzle Design: Contributing ideas and design decisions</p>
		<p> • General Support: Stepping in when needed to help with art and bug fixes</p>
		
		<p>My approach was task driven and flexible. I worked based on weekly sprint goals and picked up additional tasks to keep momentum. I approached this project with a learn as I go mindset, improving my self with Unity and audio tools as the project progressed. I prioritized tasks that were needed across multiple levels, like implementing universal sound effects or items.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="section">
		<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
		<p>Challenges Faced</p>
		<p> • Lack of clarity on implementation (e.g Where to place a certain sound effect)</p>
		<p> • Time contraints due to other courses</p>
		<p> • Audio quality issues (such as white noise and delay) during playback</p>
		<p>How I overcame them</p>
		<p> • Communicated with teammates during daily check-ins for clarity</p>
		<p> • Prioritized reusable systems to reduce more work later</p>
		<p> • Learned how to normalize and gate audio, ensuring smoother playback</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="section">
		<h2>Skills Gained and Application</h2>
		<p>Skills/Tools Learned</p>
		<p> • Audio Mixing: Compression, looping, noise gating</p>
		<p> • Unity 3D engine: Scene setup, lighting, scripting</p>
		<p> • Jira/Confluence: Sprint management, general use</p>
		<p> • Game Production Workflow: Version control with GitHub, scoping, team retrospectives</p>
		<p>Application to Future Projects</p>
		<p> • My ability to contribute to the atmosphere, mood, and art can be brought to any genre or style of game in future collborations.</p>
